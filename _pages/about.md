I am a postdoctoral researcher at [The University Of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/). I completed my Ph.D. in the School of Computer and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Adelaide, with the mentorship of Prof. Damith C Ranasinghe and Dr. [Ehsan Abbasnejad](https://ehsanabb.github.io/). My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning and Security (Trustworthy Machine Learning), with a special focus on adversarial machine learning. My academic research aims to investigate and address the robustness of deep neural networks against adversarial attacks.
